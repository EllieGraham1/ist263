        Hi I’m Ellie Graham! I’m a junior majoring in communications design and double minoring in marketing and information management and technology. I’m interested in working for a marketing or design firm and branding companies. I love to be outdoors with friends! I love to swim and hike when I’m home during the summer. One of my favorite hobbies is to sew. I love going thrifting and fixing up pieces I find or working on projects for friends and family. Fun fact about me, I have lived in 4 states and 7 homes, we move around a lot but have been in New Castle, New Hampshire for about 6 years and it is so far my favorite place I’ve lived.
